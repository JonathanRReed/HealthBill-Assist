## 👥 Demo Profiles

Switch between perspectives to showcase fairness across contexts:

- **Alex (26, hourly worker)** → steady income → eligible $240.
- **Riley (20, student)** → irregular income → smaller limit.
- **Sam (41, caregiver)** → multiple bills → smoothing demo.

Profiles change deposits, bills, and offer outcomes.

## 🔑 Core Logic (Mock)

- **Eligibility**: recent deposit ≤ 21d, ≤ 2 NSF in 60d, stable income
- **Limit**: 50% of average biweekly deposit (capped at $500)
- **Fee**: ~1% of amount ($1–$5 cap), flat, non-compounding
- **APR-equivalent**: computed for comparability only
- **Hardship**: extend repayment by 1 cycle, **no extra cost**
